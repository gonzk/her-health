It collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.\nThe lungs give the blood a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product.\nOxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, including the left atrium and ventricle.\nThe left side of the heart pumps blood through the largest artery in the body (aorta) to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients.\n', 'Risk factors': ""\nAge. Growing older increases your risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle.\nSex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. The risk for women increases after menopause.\nFamily history. A family history of heart disease increases your risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).\nSmoking. Nicotine tightens your blood vessels, and carbon monoxide can damage their inner lining, making them more susceptible to atherosclerosis. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers.\nPoor diet. A diet that's high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol can contribute to the development of heart disease.\nHigh blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can result in hardening and thickening of your arteries, narrowing the vessels through which blood flows.\nHigh blood cholesterol levels. High levels of cholesterol in your blood can increase the risk of plaque formation and atherosclerosis.\nDiabetes. Diabetes increases your risk of heart disease. Both conditions share similar risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.\nObesity. Excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors.\nPhysical inactivity. Lack of exercise also is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its other risk factors as well.\nStress. Unrelieved stress may damage your arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.\nPoor dental health. It's important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often, and have regular dental checkups. If your teeth and gums aren't healthy, germs can enter your bloodstream and travel to your heart, causing endocarditis.\n""}","{'link': 'https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961', 'Overview': 'Experiencing occasional anxiety is a normal part of life.

A big event or a buildup of smaller stressful life situations may trigger excessive anxiety — for example, a death in the family, work stress or ongoing worry about finances.\nPersonality.
